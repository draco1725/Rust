//here lets see an example

fn main() {
  let num;
  println!("{}",num);
} //this code wont work and gives out error as it make sure about memory safety here


//Lets try another example

fn main() {
  let num;
  
  if true{
      num=2;
}
  else {
      num=4;
}

  println!("{}",num);
} //it gets print out
