//Signed = holds + and - values
//Unsigned = holds only + values

//Range

//Signed:
i8 = -128 to +127
i16 = -32768 to + 32767

Formula : -2^(n-1) to -2^(n-1)  //here "n" is 8  anythhing which you want it can be 16, 32, 128 any size


//Unigned:
u8 = 0 to 255
u16 = 0 to 65535

Formula: 0 to 2^(n)-1


//Float : they holds decimal value
